# Opening the dataset
# ----------------------------
# We open the data, using SBopen, then we filter the dataframe so that only passes are left,
# This includes remioing throw-ins.

#%%
# Making the pass map using iterative solution
# ----------------------------
# Draw the pitch and iterate through the passes. We check if a pass was made by Lucy Bronze.
# If so, we take the starting coordinates of a pass and plot a circle.
# Then we subtract the coordinates beginning of the pass
# from the end of passes in order to draw pass arrows.

# Making the pass map using mplsoccer functions

# Using scatter method we draw circles where the pass started

# Plotting multiple pass maps on one figure
# ----------------------------
# mplsoccer allows to draw multiple plots on one plot. Let's demonstrate how to do that by
# plotting passes made by all of England's players.
# To do so we first filter out players from England. We plot 16 pitches in 4 rows and columns. Then, for each
# player, on a separate axis, their pass map is plotted. As the last step, we remove unnecessary pitches
# (during 2019 World Cup only 3, not 5, changes were allowed) and set the title.
